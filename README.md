### Instructions for grading TA ###
* Link: http://ec2-52-15-177-59.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/~zachmiller/newssite/start.php
* We have set up 3 default users: user1 (password = 123), user2 (password = 456), and user3 (password = 789).  Some sample stories, comments, and upvotes/downvotes were added.

### Creative portion description ###
* Upvotes and downvotes: Registered users can upvote or downvote any comment on the site once.  There is also a reset button if the user wants to remove their upvote or downvote.  Next to the upvote/downvote buttons is a counter that shows the total score of each comment (for example 5 upvotes and 1 downvote gives a score of 4)
* Deleting a user: Registered users can delete their accounts on their 'My Account' page.  This deletes every story and comment that the user has ever posted, and gets rid of all their upvotes/downvotes. 
* My Account: Registered users have a 'My Account' page where they can view all the stories that they have posted.  Users can create, edit, and delete their stories from this page.  Comments and upvotes/downvotes can be added to a story by clicking 'Go to Story'.
